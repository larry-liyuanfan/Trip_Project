# Weekly Delivery Record

This is the canonical weekly delivery document. Each week keeps its original
scope, acceptance checklist, measured results, and known limitations. New
weeks append sections instead of replacing earlier delivery history.

## Week 1: OTA Multimodal VLM Engineering Foundation

### Objective

Build a reproducible local foundation for an OTA multimodal search system:
Dockerized model serving, a FastAPI image-understanding API, a small Yelp data
sample, deterministic fallback behavior, and experiment records.

### Completion Checklist

- [x] Initialize the Git repository and project directory structure.
- [x] Add the README, Dockerfile, Docker Compose configuration, and vLLM launcher.
- [x] Add the FastAPI scaffold and deterministic image-understanding fallback.
- [x] Add structured image-understanding request and response schemas.
- [x] Add sample POI, review, and image data.
- [x] Add model-selection and API-design documentation.
- [x] Start a real vLLM service on the local NVIDIA GPU.
- [x] Verify live single-image inference through the API.
- [x] Record the first real model experiment with its Git commit and runtime parameters.
- [x] Prepare more than 10 local Yelp subset images.
- [x] Add a multi-image live test as a stretch item.

### Delivered Artifacts

- API routes: `/health`, `/v1/image-understanding`, `/v1/visual-search`, and `/v1/travel-planning`.
- Docker services for the API and `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.5`.
- Stable local smoke model: `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct` on an 8GB GPU.
- Yelp sample outputs: 200 businesses, 1,000 reviews, and 581 multimodal items.
- Experiment records in `experiments/experiment_log.md`, `experiments/results.csv`, and `experiments/failure_cases.md`.

### Verification and Limitations

- The Week 1 unit-test baseline passed 9 tests.
- Single-image live inference completed through the vLLM OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Multi-image input reached the live model, but the small model sometimes returned truncated or malformed JSON. This was recorded as a non-blocking stretch limitation.
- Qwen2.5-VL-3B was not used for the stable smoke path because model loading and profiling exceeded the comfortable margin of the local 8GB GPU.

## Week 2: Yelp Multimodal Dataset Processing

### Objective

Build and verify a full-data Yelp pipeline for archive extraction, streaming
parsing, image validation, strong/medium/weak multimodal alignment, CLIP
semantic denoising, and mentor-facing reporting.

### Completion Checklist

- [x] Extract all 5 core Yelp JSON files, photo metadata, local photos, and official documentation.
- [x] Normalize raw, interim, processed, validation, log, and report directories.
- [x] Stream all business, review, and photo metadata records without loading the full sources into memory.
- [x] Filter invalid reviews and record every rejection reason.
- [x] Validate every referenced local image for existence and readability.
- [x] Build non-empty-caption strong pairs joined by `photo_id`.
- [x] Build image-business attribute pairs joined by `business_id`.
- [x] Build bounded business-level weak image-review groups.
- [x] Run CLIP image-review scoring in an isolated GPU Docker task.
- [x] Validate output files, schemas, counts, image paths, and Parquet storage.
- [x] Generate the detailed Yelp processing report.

### Measured Full-Run Results

| Metric | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Businesses parsed | 150,346 |
| Raw review rows | 6,990,280 |
| Valid review rows | 6,989,830 |
| Photo metadata rows | 200,100 |
| Valid local images | 199,994 |
| Missing local images | 0 |
| Corrupted/unreadable images | 106 |
| Covered cities | 1,416 |
| Strong non-empty-caption pairs | 96,733 |
| Medium image-business pairs | 199,994 |
| Weak business groups | 36,673 |
| CLIP candidates scored | 555,459 |
| CLIP pairs retained at threshold 0.25 | 131,146 |

### Reproducible Commands

```bash
pip install -r requirements-data.txt
python scripts/parse_yelp_json.py --config configs/data_processing.yaml
python scripts/build_yelp_alignment.py --config configs/data_processing.yaml
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml stop vllm
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile data run --rm clip-denoising
python scripts/generate_yelp_report.py --config configs/data_processing.yaml
python scripts/validate_week2_pipeline.py --config configs/data_processing.yaml
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

### Delivered Artifacts and Limits

- `requirements-data.txt` remains independent of vLLM, torch, and CLIP.
- `requirements-clip.txt` and `docker/Dockerfile.clip` define the isolated CLIP runtime.
- Large raw files, generated Parquet files, images, and model weights remain ignored.
- Full review processing uses bounded chunk writes; image validation uses bounded worker batches.
- CLIP used `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` on CUDA. vLLM must be stopped first because both workloads cannot safely share the local 8GB GPU.
- The mentor-facing output is `reports/yelp_multimodal_data_processing_report_part1.md`.

## Promotion Rule

Weekly work is implemented and verified on `dev`, promoted unchanged to `stg`
for mentor review, and promoted from `stg` to `main` only after approval. A
completed checklist is updated on `dev` before promotion so all downstream
branches inherit the same delivery state.
